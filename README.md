# Warwick +
A custom design primarily using hash-tables with separate chaining. Other datastructure also used to store the movies and their relevant metadata for Warwick+ (Coursework)

Built to be as efficient as possible for hundreds of thousands of movies. Graded at 88%.

## What I learnt
I realised that building the data structures and their algorithms from the ground up can be useful if you want to implement slightly modified functionality to the structure.
I learnt that hash-map's have large trade-offs in the sorts of collision resolution schemes you have. There are many ways to build a hash-map. though in essence, it sacrifices space complexity, for reduced time complexity.
Understood the workings of a min-heap and max-heap to a greater extent. It reslts in O(nlogn) sorting and an easy way to get top K elements of a certain category.
